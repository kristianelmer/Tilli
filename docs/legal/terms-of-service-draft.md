# Talli Terms of Service Draft

Status: draft for founder/legal review  
Last updated: 2026-06-16  
Blocks: #72 remains open until human/legal signoff

## Product Scope

Talli is a holding-first accounting and filing app for simple Norwegian holding
AS companies. Launch scope is the annual holding compliance loop:

- `aksjonærregisteroppgaven`
- `årsregnskap`
- `skattemelding for AS`

Talli is not a full accounting system for all AS companies. Launch scope excludes
VAT, payroll, invoicing, customer/supplier ledgers, foreign tax complexity,
advanced corporate actions, audit-obligation cases, and legal/tax advisory work.

## User Responsibility

The user remains responsible for:

- having authority to act for the company;
- entering complete and correct source data;
- reviewing filing previews before submission;
- resolving hard readiness blocks;
- deciding whether to invite an accountant or advisor;
- keeping exported archives when leaving Talli.

Talli can block unsupported cases, show warnings, generate deterministic filing
data, and store receipts where available. Talli does not guarantee that a filing
is accepted by authorities, avoids fees, or replaces professional judgment in
complex cases.

## Direct Filing Limits

Direct filing may be enabled per obligation only after authority access,
test-environment evidence, security review, billing gate, and production
credential gate pass.

Before a production gate passes, Talli may offer previews, simulations, archive
exports, validation feedback, and support-boundary guidance. These must not be
marketed as completed live authority filing.

## Billing and Refunds

Billing follows the founder pricing gate:

- monthly subscription covers use of the workspace;
- filing package may be charged only after readiness passes;
- unsupported cases must not be charged for a filing package;
- if Talli accepts a supported case and fails because of Talli filing logic or
  integration, the filing package is refund-eligible.

Refund eligibility does not cover user-provided incorrect data, missing authority
access, unsupported cases, missed deadlines outside Talli control, or authority
outages unless Talli has made a separate written commitment.

## Support Boundary

Talli support can help users understand app state, readiness blockers, supported
workflows, export files, receipts, and known product limits.

Support must not provide bespoke legal advice, investment advice, tax planning,
or accountant approval for unsupported cases. Needs-accountant cases should be
blocked, escalated, or exported for external review.

## Required Human Review Before Publication

- Founder approves commercial terms and refund wording.
- Legal reviewer approves liability, consumer/business customer, and jurisdiction wording.
- Security reviewer confirms terms align with data-processing and incident docs.
- Launch reviewer confirms no claim conflicts with `docs/launch/clearance-checklist.md`.
