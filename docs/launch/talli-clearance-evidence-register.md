# Talli Clearance Evidence Register

Status: prepared for founder/legal review  
Last updated: 2026-06-17  
Blocks: #71 remains open until human/legal signoff

This register turns `docs/launch/clearance-checklist.md` into a reviewable
evidence log. It is not trademark clearance.

Machine-checkable signoff gate:

- Implementation: `app/lib/launch-signoff.ts`
- Test: `npm run test:launch-signoff`
- Required key for this issue: `launch_legal_name_public_copy`
- Closure rule: reviewer, review date, evidence link, and decision must be
  recorded as `approved`. Pending, rejected, incomplete, or stale evidence keeps
  #71 open.

## Search Sources

Official/manual sources to use for final review:

- Patentstyret trademark/design/patent search: https://search.patentstyret.no/advanced/
- Patentstyret company-name/distinctive-sign guidance: https://www.patentstyret.no/immaterielle-rettigheter/foretaksnavn
- Brønnøysund register search: https://www.brreg.no/registersok/
- Altinn name-choice guidance: https://info.altinn.no/starte-og-drive/starte/valg-av-navn/

Supplemental web search notes from 2026-06-16:

- Search surfaced an old Patentstyret bulletin hit for `Flli Talli SpA`, apparently unrelated goods/classes.
- Search surfaced `talli.ai`, a separate product/brand outside `talli.no`.
- Search surfaced Brønnøysund/person-name references containing `Talli`, not clear product/company-name conflicts.

Supplemental web search notes from 2026-06-17:

- Patentstyret-indexed result still surfaces `Flli Talli SpA` in an old 2012
  trademark bulletin, with goods outside accounting/finance software. This is
  not clearance because it is not a live official trademark-search decision.
- Brønnøysund-indexed results surface `BASSAM TALLI SKREDDER OG SYSTUE`
  (`929 054 466`) and a related sub-entity (`929 234 812`), apparently sewing
  repair, not accounting/filing software. This is not company-name clearance.
- Patentstyret's public site describes Patentstyret/NIPO as granting patent,
  trademark and design registrations in Norway. Final clearance should use
  Patentstyret's own search UI and, if doubt remains, counsel.

These supplemental notes are weak evidence. Final decision must use the official
search sources above and, if doubt remains, trademark counsel.
