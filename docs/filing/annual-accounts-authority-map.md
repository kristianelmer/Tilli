# Årsregnskap Authority Map

Status: source-backed map plus RR0002 evidence register  
Research date: 2026-06-16  
Target filing: `årsregnskap` / RR-0002  

This map defines what Talli can validate from public sources before production annual-accounts filing. It is not a complete production integration spec.

## Public Filing Surface

RR-0002 is the Altinn annual-accounts form used to submit annual accounts to Regnskapsregisteret. Altinn states that complete annual accounts must be submitted by companies with accounting obligations, normally no later than 31 July to avoid late filing fees.

Altinn states that RR-0002 consists of:

- Hovedskjema.
- Regnskapsskjema with accounting currency and accounting figures for income statement and balance sheet.
- Notes for small enterprises, including at minimum number of annual full-time equivalents.
- Attachments where relevant.

Altinn annual-accounts guidance states that a complete annual-account set normally includes:

- Income statement.
- Balance sheet.
- Notes.
- Annual report, not for small enterprises.
- Sustainability reporting, only when required.
- Cash-flow analysis, not for small enterprises.
- Auditor's report, if audit obligation applies.

Brønnøysund states that after processing, the enterprise receives a decision in Altinn inbox, and that annual accounts and tax return are separate reporting obligations.

## Machine Submission Surface

Brønnøysund documentation links Regnskapsregisteret machine reporting documentation. Digdir states that a new machine submission API for annual accounts has been developed and documented, supports system user, ID-porten, and a combination where a system user can automate data filling before a person signs.

Production implications:

- Talli can model annual-account data and readiness from public sources.
- Talli now has a narrow RR0002 field evidence pack for a simple holding AS, but cannot claim production RR-0002 filing until generated payloads, attachment rules, signing flow, feedback, and receipt behavior are validated in TT02 or equivalent test environment.
- Brønnøysund docs state system user can fill/upload/lock, but signature requires ID-porten; owner-managed filing therefore needs an ID-porten-only or hybrid system-user/person signing flow.
- `buildFilingReleaseGates` must remain `production_disabled` until
  accepted `authority_test_runs` evidence for `aarsregnskap` has receipt and
  archive refs, and the persisted `launch_signoffs` key
  `annual_accounts_authority` is approved with reviewer/date/evidence/decision.

## Talli Launch Subset

Supported for validation:

- Small Norwegian holding AS.
- No audit obligation.
- One accounting year.
- Balance sheet and income statement totals from posted ledger.
- Notes represented as checklist/metadata, not full legal note generation.
- General meeting approval confirmed.
- Annual accounts not yet production-submitted.

Blocked or unsupported:

- Audit obligation.
- Annual report obligation.
- Sustainability reporting.
- Cash-flow statement obligation.
- Complex notes beyond small holding AS.
- Replacement of already submitted annual accounts.
- Non-Norwegian language annual accounts without dispensation.

## Launch Schema Decisions

These decisions are the source-backed launch schema for a simple holding AS. A row marked `blocked` must not be treated as production-ready.

| Authority requirement | Source evidence | Talli source data | Launch decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reporting obligation and deadline | Brønnøysund states reporting-obligated enterprises must submit a complete annual-account set by 31 July, and the tax return is a separate obligation. | `companies`, `annual_data`, `filing_readiness_snapshots` | Supported as readiness/deadline data. |
| RR-0002 main form | Brønnøysund official Postman example exposes `dataFormatId=1266`, `dataFormatVersion=51820`, and key hovedskjema orids. | `companies`, `annual_data`, `authority_permissions`, future accountant/auditor metadata | Evidence mapped for simple holding AS; production still blocked until TT02 validation. |
| Accounting currency and scale | Official Postman example exposes `valuta` orid `34984`. | Ledger amounts currently stored as NOK numeric values. | Supported for NOK/whole-kroner launch only; other currencies/scales blocked. |
| Income statement figures | Official Postman example exposes result tags/orids including `sumDriftskostnad`, `sumFinansinntekter`, `resultatFoerSkattekostnad`, and `aarsresultat`. | `ledger_entries.lines`, annual preview totals | Evidence mapped for aggregate launch fields; implementation slice needed. |
| Balance-sheet figures | Official Postman example exposes balance tags/orids for investments, bank/cash, equity, and debt. | `ledger_entries.lines`, opening balance, investment register | Evidence mapped for simple holding AS fields; implementation slice needed. |
| Small-enterprise notes | Official Postman example exposes `antallAarsverk` orid `37467`. | `annual_data`, future note records | Evidence mapped; implementation needs annual full-time equivalents field, default `0` for no employees/payroll. |
| Attachments | Altinn says small enterprises with no audit obligation generally do not need annual report/cash-flow attachments, while non-small cases require notes, annual report, cash-flow statement and usually auditor report as file attachments. | `documents` metadata/object references | Supported only as readiness metadata; production attachment payload is blocked. |
| Confirmation/signing | Altinn says sender confirms the annual accounts are approved by the competent body; it then goes to signing/submission. | `annual_data.general_meeting_approved`, `authority_permissions` | Readiness supported; production signing flow blocked until Altinn 3/Regnskapsregisteret flow is tested. |
| Receipt/decision | Altinn/Brønnøysund state the enterprise receives electronic feedback/decision in Altinn inbox after processing. | `filing_submissions`, archive receipt state | Simulation only; official receipt retrieval/storage is blocked. |

## Mapping to Current Engine

Current engine coverage:

- Balance preview: partial.
- Income statement preview: partial.
- General meeting approval readiness: covered.
- Bank/document warnings: partial.
- Simulated receipt: covered for simulation only.

Missing before production:

- Payload builder using `aarsregnskap-vanlig-202406`.
- TT02 validation of mapped fields.
- Annual-account note model.
- Attachment payload handling.
- Signing model.
- Altinn/Regnskapsregisteret validation feedback.
- Official receipt storage.

Current annual preview field decisions:

| Current preview field | Authority mapping decision |
| --- | --- |
| Bank balance | Candidate balance-sheet bank/cash field; blocked until RR-0002 field id is confirmed. |
| Share investments | Candidate asset/investment field; blocked until RR-0002 field id and note implications are confirmed. |
| Share capital | Candidate equity/share-capital field; blocked until RR-0002 field id is confirmed. |
| Retained earnings | Candidate equity field; blocked until RR-0002 field id and result allocation rules are confirmed. |
| Dividend/gain income | Candidate income statement financial income; blocked until exact RR-0002 field id is confirmed. |
| Admin costs | Candidate operating/other expenses; blocked until exact RR-0002 field id is confirmed. |
| Result before tax | Derived display value only; not enough for production payload. |
| General meeting approval | Supported readiness confirmation; not enough for production signature. |

## Production Blockers

- Confirm exact Altinn 3/Regnskapsregisteret machine-submission API contract.
- Confirm whether owner-managed direct filing can use ID-porten-only, system-user-only, or hybrid flow.
- Confirm required payload schemas and attachment restrictions for a small holding AS.
- Confirm feedback and receipt retrieval behavior.
- Validate in test environment before production.

## Follow-Up Implementation Slices

1. Add `annual_accounts_payload_map` with RR-0002 field ids for simple holding AS income statement, balance sheet, currency, scale, and small-enterprise note fields.
2. Add annual-account note model, starting with annual full-time equivalents and small-enterprise note confirmations.
3. Add attachment rules for no-audit small AS versus non-small/audit cases.
4. Add Regnskapsregisteret/Altinn 3 adapter interface behind a disabled production gate.
5. Add test-environment runbook for signing, validation feedback, receipt/decision retrieval, and archive storage.
