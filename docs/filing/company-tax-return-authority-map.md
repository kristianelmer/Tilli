# Skattemelding for AS Authority Map

Status: source-backed map for simulation and validation  
Research date: 2026-06-16  
Target filing: `skattemelding for AS` / company tax return

This map defines what Talli can validate from public sources before production company-tax-return filing. It is not a complete production integration spec.

## Public Filing Surface

Skatteetaten states that companies must retrieve and submit the tax return with business specification through an accounting or year-end system.

The public `skattemelding upersonlig` API documentation describes a data API that delivers information in a business tax return. It is not a direct filing API for Talli's production submission flow, but it is useful for data shape and authority vocabulary.

The Skatteetaten `skattemeldingen` repository contains system-supplier material for tax return and business specification integration. Its README states that it covers persons, sole proprietorships, and companies, and that it contains:

- Docs for information model, API, test, validations, and texts.
- Source files for XSDs, code lists, request/response envelopes, calculations, and examples.
- `skattemeldingUpersonlig_v1` XSD for AS 2021.
- Request and response envelope XSDs.
- Validation result XSDs.
- Example file for `upersonligSkattemeldingV1.xml`.

Altinn's legacy overview states that company tax return consists of a main tax-return form and several attachment forms, for example business specification/næringsoppgave. It also states role requirements for filling, signing, and auditor cases.

## API and Access Notes

The `skattemelding upersonlig` API docs state:

- API v4 delivers tax returns for 2024 and 2025.
- OpenAPI is in SwaggerHub and is authoritative if it differs from the docs page.
- Scope: `skatteetaten:skattemeldingupersonlig`.
- Access requires Skatteetaten approval/right package and legal basis; the API contains confidential information.
- The API is not adapted for system-user solution and display in an end-user system.
- Error codes include authentication, authorization, validation input, data-format, missing tax return, missing organization, and unsupported format cases.
- Test data is listed for the service in Skatteetaten's external test environment.

Production implication:

- Talli's current tax return preview cannot be treated as a production filing payload.
- The `skattemelding upersonlig` API is useful for model/validation research but does not by itself prove direct filing capability.
- Production filing must use the current Skatteetaten system-supplier submission flow and current schemas, not the simplified preview model.

## Talli Launch Subset

Supported for validation:

- Simple Norwegian holding AS.
- Dividend income under clear `fritaksmetoden`.
- 3 percent income-recognition add-back for qualifying dividends.
- Simple admin costs.
- No VAT/payroll/customer invoicing.
- No group contribution.
- No foreign tax credit.
- No complex shareholder loan case.

Blocked or unsupported:

- Unclear `fritaksmetoden` classification.
- Group contributions.
- Advanced loss carry-forward workflows.
- Foreign withholding/tax credit.
- Controlled transactions requiring advanced reporting.
- Company-to-personal-shareholder loans without accountant review.
- Audit or auditor-signature-dependent cases.

## Launch Schema Decisions

These decisions are the source-backed launch schema for simple holding AS tax return work. A row marked `blocked` must not be treated as production-ready.

| Authority requirement | Source evidence | Talli source data | Launch decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Filing via system | Skatteetaten states company tax returns for AS must be retrieved and submitted through an accounting or year-end system. | Talli app/backend | Supported as product direction; direct filing remains blocked until system-supplier flow is implemented. |
| Deadline | Skatteetaten states the ordinary deadline is 31 May each year. | `deadlines`, `filing_readiness_snapshots` | Supported as deadline/readiness data. |
| No-activity companies | Skatteetaten states the tax return must be filed even if the company has had no turnover. | `annual_data.no_activity_confirmed` | Supported for readiness; payload remains blocked. |
| Tax return plus business specification | Skatteetaten states the company must retrieve and submit the tax return with `næringsspesifikasjon` through the system. | `ledger_entries`, `holding_actions`, `annual_data` | Blocked until current schema/code-list field mapping exists. |
| Validation before submission | Skatteetaten states validation checks the tax return and business specification before submission and returns feedback. | future validation adapter, `filing_submissions.feedback_items` | Blocked until validation service integration and feedback mapping exist. |
| Altinn receipt/archive | Skatteetaten states receipt and submitted information are available in Altinn archive after signed submission. | `filing_submissions`, archive export | Simulation only; official receipt/archive retrieval is blocked. |
| Access packages/roles | Skatteetaten lists supported access packages and roles and notes transition from old Altinn roles to access packages. | `authority_permissions` | Readiness supported; production access package/delegation flow blocked. |
| `skattemelding upersonlig` API | Skatteetaten API docs state this service delivers information appearing in a company's tax return. | potential import/pre-fill adapter | Data-reading candidate only; not evidence of production submission. |

## Mapping to Current Engine

Current engine coverage:

- Uses posted ledger entries: covered.
- Calculates dividend 3 percent add-back from structured action metadata: partial.
- Estimates tax at 22 percent: simulation only.
- Blocks company-to-shareholder receivable: partial.
- Produces simulated receipt: simulation only.

Missing before production:

- Current Skatteetaten submission payload/schema mapping.
- Næringsspesifikasjon field mapping.
- Attachment/vedlegg handling.
- Validation service integration.
- Skatteetaten feedback mapping.
- Official receipt/status storage.
- Official test-environment acceptance.

Current tax preview field decisions:

| Current preview field | Authority mapping decision |
| --- | --- |
| Result before tax | Derived display value only. Blocked until mapped to current `skattemelding`/`næringsspesifikasjon` field ids. |
| Dividend income under `fritaksmetoden` | Supported as Talli domain concept, but production blocked until mapped to current tax-return/business-specification fields and code lists. |
| 3 percent `fritaksmetoden` add-back | Supported as simulation calculation, but production blocked until exact authority field(s), calculation basis, and rounding rules are confirmed. |
| Admin costs | Supported ledger input, but production blocked until deductible-cost fields in `næringsspesifikasjon` are mapped. |
| Estimated tax at 22 percent | Simulation only. The submitted tax return should not rely on this as an authority payload field. |
| Tax settlement/payment/refund records | Archive/readiness data only. Not a company tax-return payload mapping yet. |
| Company-to-personal-shareholder loan | Blocked before production; requires accountant review and authority field mapping. |

## Production Blockers

- Identify the exact current submission API/flow for company tax return, separate from the `skattemelding upersonlig` data API.
- Confirm the current XSD/JSON schemas and code lists for the relevant income year.
- Map Talli ledger/tax concepts to `skattemelding` and `næringsspesifikasjon` fields.
- Validate generated payloads against official schemas and test environment.
- Confirm access package, Maskinporten/Altinn delegation, signing, feedback, and receipt behavior for owner-managed filing.

## Follow-Up Implementation Slices

1. Add `skattemelding_payload_map` for simple holding AS, covering result, balance, dividends, `fritaksmetoden` add-back, admin costs, and basic equity/debt fields.
2. Add `næringsspesifikasjon` schema/code-list validation harness for the active income year.
3. Add Skatteetaten validation adapter behind a disabled production gate and persist structured validation feedback.
4. Add access-package/delegation runbook for owner-managed AS filing through Talli.
5. Add no-activity tax-return fixture that proves the filing is still required and maps to the minimum valid payload once schemas are confirmed.
