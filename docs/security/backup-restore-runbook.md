# Backup, Restore, and Export Launch Gate

Production direct filing is blocked until Talli has a recent passing restore test.

## Launch-Critical Data

The launch restore fixture must cover:

- `companies`
- `company_memberships`
- `annual_data`
- `opening_balance_setups`
- `opening_shareholders`
- `ledger_entries`
- `bank_transactions`
- `holding_actions`
- `investment_positions`
- `documents`
- `filing_previews`
- `filing_submissions`
- `filing_readiness_snapshots`
- `filing_overrides`
- `filing_review_comments`
- `billing_accounts`
- `authority_permissions`
- `audit_events`

Document object storage is represented by document metadata plus `storage_key`. A restore test may restore metadata before object bytes, but must produce explicit warnings for missing object content.

## Required Restore Test

1. Export one company-year archive from persisted workspace data.
2. Build a backup manifest from the archive.
3. Restore the archive into an isolated workspace/test schema or fixture target.
4. Verify ledger entries, holding actions, document metadata, filing previews, filing submissions, receipts, review comments, billing, and audit events are present.
5. Verify restored data uses a different target company id for isolation.
6. Record restore test date, target, operator, result, and missing-object warnings.

## Launch Gate

Production direct filing remains blocked if:

- no restore test has passed, or
- the latest passing restore test is older than 30 days, or
- restore integrity reports missing launch-critical rows.

Automated coverage:

- `npm run test:backup-restore`
- `npm run test:archive`

Machine-checkable signoff gate:

- Implementation: `app/lib/launch-signoff.ts`
- Test: `npm run test:launch-signoff`
- Required key: `security_restore`
- Closure rule: reviewer, review date, evidence link, and decision must be
  recorded as `approved`; the review date must be 30 days old or newer.
